<h2>Hi, I’m Vritti 👋</h2>

<p>
I’m a cybersecurity enthusiast learning security the hands-on way — through
CTFs, labs, and real-world incident analysis.
</p>

<p>
I care more about <b>understanding how things work</b> than collecting tools.
</p>

<p>
Currently spending most of my time on:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>🛡️ Digital & Windows Forensics</li>
  <li>🧩 CTFs and lab-based learning (TryHackMe)</li>
  <li>📧 Phishing and incident analysis</li>
</ul>

<p>
Outside tech, I help with managing and creating content for <b>Sarika Arts</b>
and enjoy thinking through problems step-by-step.

<p><i>Learning in public, slowly and honestly.</i></p>
